# Pokencyclopedia

This is a sample application for me to play around with Angular. It utilizes [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get information and display it.


# Running / Build

Run and build like a normal Angular application.

To run locally:
```
ng serve
```

To build:
```
ng build --prod
```
